## Questions

1. What is the difference between `new` and `create` for a model?

  `new` initializes the instance for the object. `create` does the same thing, and then saves the information for the object.

2. What command combined with `new` will emulate the same behavior as `create`?

  `save`

3. What is the default integer column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?

  `id`

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "Kira" in the database?

  ```
  Cat.create(:name => "Kira")
  ```

5. How did you like this homework in comparison with the previous homeworks?

  This homework was more confusing because the lecture ended up quite confusing. Also, the homework doesn't have us try out filling out the databases, so we don't get to experiment with seeing what that's like without doing it on our own.
